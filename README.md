VioletSpark (hosted at violetspark.net)

A centralized location used to display my abilities as a programmer.

Not everyone understands or even knows what a "github" is and how to use it. This website is meant to be easily accessible to all. It will include links to my projects (the code on GitHub and a live demonstration where applicable), ways to contact me and fun facts about myself.
